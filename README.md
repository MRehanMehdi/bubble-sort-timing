# Bubble Sort - Empirical Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the C++ implementation of **Bubble Sort** used for empirical analysis of time complexity.  
The project is part of a major assignment that analyzes how the execution time changes with different input sizes.

---

## How to Run
- Download or clone this repository.
- Open the `bubblesort+time.cpp` file in any C++ IDE or editor (like Visual Studio, CodeBlocks, etc.).
- Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
  ```bash
  g++ "bubblesort+time.cpp" -o bubblesort_time

- Run the executable: `./bubblesort_time`


## Purpose
The goal is to:
- Measure the execution time of Bubble Sort for different input sizes.
- Plot a graph showing time vs. input size.
- Compare the observed results with the theoretical time complexity **O(nÂ²)**.
