**Bubble Sort - Empirical Analysis**
**Overview**
This repository contains the C++ implementation of Bubble Sort used for empirical analysis of time complexity.
The project is part of a major assignment that analyzes how the execution time changes with different input sizes.

**How to Run**
-Download or clone this repository.

-Open the bubble_sort.cpp file in any C++ IDE or editor (like Visual Studio, CodeBlocks, etc.).

-Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
g++ bubble_sort.cpp -o bubble_sort
-Run the executable:
./bubble_sort
-Observe the output showing average execution times for different input sizes.

**Purpose**
The goal is to measure the execution time of Bubble Sort for different input sizes, plot a graph, and compare the results with the theoretical time complexity O(nÂ²).
